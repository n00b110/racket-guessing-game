# Racket Basics #


## Atomic Data ##
-----------------

Atomic data is the basic building block of any data in Racket/Lisp.

Atomic data are simply data types that cannot be broken into smaller components.
Things like numbers, identifiers, etc.

```
123 ; evaluates to 123
pi ; -> 3.1415926..



```

### Lists ###

In Racket, lists are the primary **non-atomic** data structures

```
> (list 1 2 3); -> (1 2 3)

; s-expressions are known as symbolic-expresions
; 





```
